## What is Blockchain

Blockchain transactions and ledgers are different. Blockchain introduces a new kind of transaction â€“ a multiparty transaction - that is signed by everyone involved in the transaction. Blockchain ledgers are different too; the same ledger is replicated in every organization in the network, and kept synchronized using a process called *consensus*. Moreover, these ledgers are *immutable* and *final*; once a multi-party transaction is written to the ledger, it cannot be reversed.

Blockchain introduces the idea of a *smart contract*. It describes in code what a transaction generated by the smart contract looks like. For example, a car contract might use logic to check that you're the current owner of the car, and that a purchaser has the required funds. 

### Blockchain for business

Businesses  are required to carry out **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** checks, which require businesses to know who they are dealing with. This means that business blockchains require identifiable participants and favor features such as *privacy* and *confidentiality*.

### Hyperledger Fabric

A Hyperledger Fabric network consists of three key types of components:

- **Peer node**: holds a copy of the ledger and is responsible for running smart contracts.
- **Orderer node**: part of a distributed ordering service that agrees the order that transactions are added to the ledger.
- **Certificate Authority**: responsible for issuing the certificates that identify users and organizations on the network.
