## What is Blockchain

Blockchain transactions and ledgers are different. Blockchain introduces a new kind of transaction â€“ a multiparty transaction - that is signed by everyone involved in the transaction. Blockchain ledgers are different too; the same ledger is replicated in every organization in the network, and kept synchronized using a process called *consensus*. Moreover, these ledgers are *immutable* and *final*; once a multi-party transaction is written to the ledger, it cannot be reversed.

Blockchain introduces the idea of a *smart contract*. It describes in code what a transaction generated by the smart contract looks like. For example, a car contract might use logic to check that you're the current owner of the car, and that a purchaser has the required funds. 

### Blockchain for business

Businesses  are required to carry out **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** checks, which require businesses to know who they are dealing with. This means that business blockchains require identifiable participants and favor features such as *privacy* and *confidentiality*.

### Hyperledger Fabric

A Hyperledger Fabric network consists of three key types of components:

- **Peer node**: holds a copy of the ledger and is responsible for running smart contracts.
- **Orderer node**: part of a distributed ordering service that agrees the order that transactions are added to the ledger.
- **Certificate Authority**: responsible for issuing the certificates that identify users and organizations on the network.

In Hyperledger Fabric, a smart contract uses a *state* database containing the current value of all business objects in the ledger to simplify transaction generation. Each smart contract can run on a set of peers in each organization.

### Smart contract determinism

Whilst it may look like it, the effect of `context.putState` is not immediate. The business object identified by myAssetId will only be updated when every organization in the network agrees with the generated transaction response. This requires the consensus process to complete across the network. We need to ensure that our smart contract transactions are *deterministic*; that is, each must always generate the same transaction response for a given set of transaction inputs.
