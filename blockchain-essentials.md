# Blockchain Essentials

## The business context of blockchain

### Ledgers, Transactions and Contracts

**Ledger** - an important log of all transactions. Describes the inputs and outputs of the business

**Transaction** - an asset transfer between participants

**Contract** - the conditions for a transaction to occur

There are multiple participants that duplicate the ;ledgers and contracts.

**Blockchain** is a shared replicated ledger with smart contracts. A transaction log shared between participants. 

**Smart Contracts** are just pieces of code

Blockchain provides:
- *consensus*: all participants agree that the transaction is valid
- *provenance*: history of the asset
- *immutability*: no participant can tamper with the transaction once it's agreed
- *finality*: once the transaction is committed it can not be reversed

All blockchains aim to provide *irrefutable proof* that a set of transaction occurred between participants
